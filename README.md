# ERP AI Prediction

This project demonstrates how to integrate AI-driven inventory alerts and sales forecasting into an ERP system using Keras and LSTM. The project includes data extraction from an ERP system, data preprocessing, model training using LSTM, and displaying results using Streamlit.

## Project Structure

- `data_extraction.py`: Extract data from the ERP system.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Preprocess the extracted data.
- `model_training.py`: Train an LSTM model using Keras.
- `prediction_integration.py`: Integrate the predictions back into the ERP system.
- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit app to display the sales forecast.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
